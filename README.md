# 🐂 About Paichal – Bull Race Calculator

## 🌾 What is Paichal?
Paichal is a modern digital platform built to manage traditional **Eruthu Vidum Vizha (Bull Race)** events across Tamil Nadu.  
It replaces manual stopwatches, notebooks, and paper-based results with a precise, fair, and professional digital system designed especially for village committees and bull owners.
